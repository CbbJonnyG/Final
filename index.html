    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <div class= 'bcd'>
        <img src="images/jonny.JPG" width="500" height="350">
        <p>As a photographer I love to capture moments that I find valuable to keep for a long time. As well as an artistic eye when it comes to different angles in an image. I decided to become a photographer after I realized how much fun I can have taking these images. My strengths include efficiency in the Adobe Cloud and I am a monster when the camera is in my hands.</p>

    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
    <div class= 'bd'>
        <p>As a graphic designer I can create posters, billboards, socail meadia ads you name it. I first began my road as a graphic designer in highschool and grew a liking of graphic design. My strengths are mostly social media ads and posters. What you see here is a time;ine I had to make for one of my courses earlier this year.</p>
